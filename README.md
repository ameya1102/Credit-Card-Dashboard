# Credit-Card-Dashboard

**Problem Statement**
Analyzing Changing Credit Card Spending Patterns to Optimize Customer Engagement and Risk Management.

**Background:**
In today’s dynamic financial environment, banks and financial institutions face the twin challenges of increasing customer engagement while managing credit risk. With millions of credit card transactions flowing in daily, it’s vital to understand how spending behavior changes over time, especially across customer demographics, locations, expense types, and card tiers.

**Business Challenge:**
The finance team of a large retail bank wants to:
- Identify which spending categories contribute most to quarterly revenue.
- Understand how spend patterns differ by city, gender, and card type.
- Detect early signs of growth or decline in customer spending.
- Use these insights to design targeted offers, cross-selling strategies, and risk controls.

**Objective:**
Build an interactive Credit Card Dashboard that visualizes:
- Quarterly spending performance by expense category.
- Transaction volume trends.
- Breakdowns by card type, gender, and city.
- Key KPIs: total spend, average spend per transaction, growth vs. previous periods.

This dashboard will help management make data-driven decisions about loyalty rewards, marketing campaigns, credit limits, and fraud monitoring.
